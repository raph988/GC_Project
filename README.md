Welcome to the GC_Project wiki!

/!\ This project is an old undocumented.

GC_Project aim to be a clients manager with contract editor to automatically generate Word files.

Python project with GUI based on PySide 2, including tools like:

- Microsoft Excel file parser to create database
- Microsoft Word file parser
- automated word generator (contracts generator based on data file containing clients info)
- database manager (serious drawback: data is stored as Pickle object -> heavy time processing when database is big)
- GUI based on PySide2 (drawback: some design items are graphically gready -> long display time when too much lines are selected)

This project is probably out-dated with obsolete python packages.
